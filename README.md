Renegade Engine A fast, modular C++20 game engine built from scratch for flexibility, performance, and full control.
Features fully custom: reflection, binary serialization, clean ECS, and an event-driven core — all written with minimal dependencies and zero editor bloat. 

Highlights
Entity-Component System: Lightweight, scalable design.
Reflection System: Static-init startup tool — no RTTI, no .gen files, minimal overhead. 
Binary Serialization: Pointer-safe, editor-ready, supports future type expansions by default. 
Event System: Callback-based, template-based, type-safe, and fully decoupled.
Editor Tools: ImGui-based inspector UI powered by real-time reflection.

Why?
Because most engines are either bloated or inflexible. Renegade is for devs who want real control: minimal layers, clean APIs, and full understanding of what’s under the hood. License: Apache 2.0.
